# miniredis-cpp

A Redis-like in-memory key-value store written in C++ for learning systems programming.

> Goal: understand how a real-world database server works under the hood
> by building a tiny version from scratch.

## Why this project?

My goal for this project is to expose myself to C++, being proficient in C, I want to utilize this towards a more object-oriented language.

- **Network programming** – sockets, event loops, handling multiple clients.
- **Data structures** – hash tables, lists, etc. applied to a real system.
- **Systems-level C++** – RAII, STL containers, wrapping low-level C APIs.

This is a **learning project**, not production software.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** C++ 
- **Platform:** macOS (POSIX sockets)

## Features (planned to update as implemented)


## Building

```bash
# Example (will update once build system is set)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

```
